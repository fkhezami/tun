                            <p>From early antiquity, Tunisia was inhabited by the indigenous Berbers.

The cuisine has been strongly influenced by French and Italian (especially Sicilian) cooking.During its era of French colonial rule Tunisia marketed its difference to metropolitan France meaning it played on French perceptions of "difference" (Orientalism) to sell the produce of the colonies to France.</p>

                            <p>The massive Roman amphitheater at El Djem dwarfs the current village around it.

                                This remarkably well-preserved Roman relic is Tunisia's top tourist attraction, one of the most popular day-trip destinations from the coast, and one of the greatest examples of amphitheater design still surviving in the world.
                                
                                The fortifications' massive weight serves as a reminder of Rome's once-dominant grasp on North Africa.
                                
                                You may still wander through the arena's halls like the gladiators did. Alternatively, ascend to the upper tiers of the seating tiers and gaze out over the arena, envisioning the fights that took place below.</p>

                            <p>Sidi Bou Said is an impossibly tiny and incredibly gorgeous clifftop town that appears to have fallen off an artist's painting.

                                For decades, artists have praised this little hamlet, which is now a posh neighborhood of Tunisia's capital.
                                
                                The whitewashed lanes, wrought-iron window frames, and bright blue doors are the epitome of Tunisian village architecture, and the Mediterranean background is the icing on the cake.
                                
                                This is a great location to spend a relaxing afternoon taking up the laid-back ambience and perhaps buying at one of the many local artist and crafts vendors.</p>

                            <p>Tataouine (Berber languages: Tiṭṭawin; Arabic: تطاوين) is a city in southern Tunisia. It is the capital of the Tataouine Governorate. The below-ground "cave dwellings" of the native Berber population, designed for coolness and protection, render the city and the area around it a tourist and film makers' attraction.
                                <br>Tataouine became the inspiration of Tatooine when the town was chosen as a filming location for exterior scenes of the desert planet in the Star Wars film series.

La Badira has 130 suites of 45m² to 160m2, five restaurants combining tradition and innovation, and the only Spa by CLARINS in the country. Intimate spaces have been created in and around the hotel with a library, an indoor fireplace, La Badira cocktail bar, and jasmine and bitter orange scented lawns. The shop, dedicated to local craftsmanship, illustrates the authenticity and charm of Tunisia. Like travelers, writers and adventurers of the last century, guests feel at home and with friends. La Badira represents all the charm of yesteryear revisited with a modern approach, a place where regular visitors and newcomers can mingle with simplicity, elegance and discretion.</div>

                <p>It doesn’t get much better than this for fans of the ancients.

                    Colossal arches and elliptical amphitheaters to rival even the Colosseum in Rome are what mark the horizon of famous El Djem.
                    
                    Tagged by UNESCO, the city is a modern one built right atop an old one, with the occasional ruin of Roman homes and arcades popping up on the corners.
                    
                    Many sights have been preserved thanks to the billowing dust storms of the surrounding Sahara, but a lack of large-scale archaeology means that the main attraction remains the huge Amphitheatre of Thysdrus.
                    
                    Delve in and stroll the changing rooms of gladiators, or stand where ancient governors once did atop the fighting pits.</p>

                    The town magnetizes visitors with its enchanting appearance, which comes as a curious mélange of Spanish, Sicilian and Castilian architecture, all balanced out by the ubiquitous Maghreb medina town of whitewashed adobe homes and palm-sprouting streets.
                    
                    However, it’s the beaches here that really take the biscuit.
                    
                    Head down to sun-kissed Hammamet Sud, where loungers meet jet skis meet sunbathers meet SCUBA outfitters.</p>

                    And where better for a taste of the dry life than the adobe mud town of Tozeur? This oases settlement in the extreme south-west of the nation is a veritable masterpiece of Berber tradition.
                    
                    For starters, it’s surrounded by swathes of verdant date palm blooms that rise straight from the ochre-hued earth.
                    
                    And then there’s its medina city, with filigrees and carvings and brick artistry straight from the old arabesque world.</p>

                    And away from the steaming Ottoman hammams and colorful Maghreb souks of the town proper, there are gorgeous beaches that sparkle turquoise blue, all fringed with luxurious hotels and palm-lined promenades.</p>

                    In the former, the so-called Ville Nouvelle, the traces of rule from Paris are all too evident.
                    
                    There are wide, tree-peppered avenues.
                    
                    There are coffee shops spilling onto the sidewalks.
                    
                    There are grand cathedrals with Gothic elements.
                    
                    And on the latter side of town; the African side, things take a turn for the arabesque.
                    
                    Lively souks packed with kaleidoscopic fabrics crawl and sprawl over one another.

                    That all makes it easy to see why this sprawling ruined site just outside of Tunis is one of the most-visited attractions in all of Tunisia.
                    
                    However, the centuries of Punic wars and Muslim invasions have left it abandoned more than once, and the remains of Carthage are not as awe-inspiring as some of the country’s other Roman treats.
                    
                    It’s worth coming though, if only to stand where great generals in the ilk of Hannibal once did!</p>

                <p>A staple of North African and Tunisian cuisine,  you simply can’t claim to be familiar with Tunisian food if you haven’t had one (or twenty) tagines filled to the brim with couscous! It is the country’s national dish after all.

                    A dish originated by the Berbers who still inhabit southern Tunisia, but you can easily find this popular dish available around the world now.
                    
                    Couscous is made from semolina wheat that is rolled into the extremely tiny pieces. 
                    
                    Traditional Tunisian couscous is typically served with chicken, fish, beef, or lamb, plus there are usually vegetables and peppers mixed in. </p>

                <h3>Hammamet</h3>
                <hr class="line-heading">               
                <p>Hammamet is a coastal town in northern Tunisia, about 41 miles south of the capital city Tunis. Its location makes it a popular destination for people who love to swim, surf, and play water sports.

                    When in Hammamet, stroll through Medina, an old and historic neighborhood by the water that’s surrounded by a wall built in the 15th century.
                    
                    You can also visit ruins from the Roman Empire era in Hammamet, like in Pupput and Kerkouane.
                    
                    But if you really love the water, head to Korbous or any of the beautiful resorts along its coastline. The golden sand in Hammamet is yours to enjoy.</p>

                <hr class="line-heading">               
                <p>Located in the central coast of Tunisia, Monastir is about 100 miles from the country’s capital city of Tunis. It used to be a fishing port but is now a resort town popular among tourists.

                    When visiting Monastir, make sure to stop by Ribat, one of the oldest Arab fortresses in Africa that’s been featured in movies such as Jesus of Nazareth (1977).
                    
                    This old building was built in 796 AD, so it carries much of Monastir and Tunisia’s history.
                    
                    But, for a relaxing day at the beach, you should stay at one of the many resort hotels in the city.</p>
